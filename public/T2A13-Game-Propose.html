        <h2><b>My game is a survival top down base building survival game (Similar to Vectorio classic for reference) I want to make a system <br>
            so enemies constantantly head towards your core. The game ends when your core breaks viva enemies damaging it through attacks. <br>
            I want to have mulitple types of enemies, several different towers you can place, a global scoring system, and a point system where you get points from
            killing enemies which allow you to buy new towers and expand your base.
